# Filling the gaps

*A practical guide for interpolation methods, from linear interpolation to machine learning, applied to engineering problems in Python.*

Engineering simulations must often be performed using incomplete data from various sources, for example when running power system studies with generator capabilities defined by a few data points in a table. In an ideal world, the manufacturer...
