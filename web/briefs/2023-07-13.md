# Symmetrical components

*A guide on how to work with power system symmetrical components and phasors in Python.*

Electrical power systems are often composed of three phases, i.e.: three sinusoidal waves delayed by 1/3 of a cycle between each other. This allows for a constant power delivery with alternating voltage and current, optimized material cost and smooth current to the load. Those three ...
