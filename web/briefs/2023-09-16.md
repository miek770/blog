# Short circuit analysis

*My thoughts and methods to simulate ANSI/IEEE short circuit currents in Python.*

This post is about my current position on open-source short circuit calculation solutions in Python. I work in Canada and we use ANSI/IEEE standards, and the open-source solutions I have found so far are all based on IEC standards. The IEC standards introduce a few factors that yields diffe...
