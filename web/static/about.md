# About myself

My name is Michel Lavoie and I'm passionate about Python programming, and my work in renewable energy. As an electrical engineer, I lead an engineering department in renewable energy and power system studies at [Tetra Tech](https://www.tetratech.com/) in Quebec, Canada.

As part of this job I developped and maintain several engineering tools (mostly in Python) and generally advocate for the use of programming in everyday engineering. For example, I have been leading the conversion of most of our engineering calculation notes from Excel to [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for a few years.

Outside of work, I have a rather wide array of interests and hobbies but I try to converge my programming projects towards Python, from [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web applications to [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) autonomous robots.
