# About myself

My name is Michel Lavoie and I'm passionate about Python programming and my work in renewable energy. As an electrical engineer, I lead an engineering department in renewable energy and power system studies at [Tetra Tech](https://www.tetratech.com/) in Quebec, Canada.

As part of this job I developped and maintain several engineering tools (mostly in Python) and generally advocate for the use of programming in everyday engineering. For example, I lead the conversion of most of our engineering calculation notes from Excel to [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in the past few years.

Outside of work, I have a rather wide array of interests and hobbies but I try to converge my programming projects towards Python, from [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web applications to [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) autonomous robots.

You can reach me through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michel-lavoie-71841526/), view most of my public projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/miek770) and at least 1 public project on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/miek770).
