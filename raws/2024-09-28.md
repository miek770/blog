# Managing and Sharing Notebooks

*How I handle dependencies for Jupyter notebooks within my engineering firm.*

For decades, Excel has been the go-to tool for engineering calculations. A few years ago, I made the decision to move away from it and convert our calculation notes to Jupyter notebooks. While the reasons for this transition are many, they all boil down to one thing: improved efficiency and quality.

What began as a small collection of Jupyter notebooks grew over time into a sprawling set of tens of notebooks, each with its own dependencies and complexity.

Up until recently, I used our private Git repository to store and share the latest versions of these notebooks. But as the number of notebooks increased, I realized it was time to improve how we handle dependencies to keep everything up to date.

>Pandas, for example, is one dependency that needs to be managed carefully. [As of version 1.4.0, the `append` method has been deprecated](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/1.4/whatsnew/v1.4.0.html#whatsnew-140-deprecations-frame-series-append), and a large portion of our notebooks relied on it to combine calculation inputs.

## Managing Dependencies with Poetry

To handle the dependencies of the entire repository, I started using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management, and pytest with nbval for testing notebook execution.

### Poetry

After installing Poetry (you can find the official instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)), I initialized the repository with:

```sh
poetry init
```

The interactive prompt guided me through adding details about the repository and specifying dependencies manually.

#### Python Versions

One limitation with Poetry is that it doesn’t manage multiple Python versions. To test notebooks with newer Python versions before migrating everyone, I use `pyenv`. Once installed, running:

```sh
pyenv install --list
```

…shows the available versions, and:

```sh
pyenv install <version>
```

…proceeds with the installation. You can then use:

```sh
pyenv global <version>
pyenv local <version>
```

…to switch between Python versions globally or locally.

In the repository, make sure the `python = "<version>"` clause in the `pyproject.toml` file matches the version you’re using with `pyenv` to avoid Poetry errors.

>Although it would be ideal to manage automated tests across multiple Python versions with Poetry, that feature isn’t available out of the box.

### Testing with Pytest and Nbval

Once the environment is set up, I run:

```sh
poetry run pytest --nbval-lax
```

This command runs tests on the notebooks, ignoring minor output differences and focusing on errors.

#### Quality Control

It’s important to note that in this repository, automated tests are focused on execution errors, not calculation accuracy. This approach differs from our work on libraries like `energy_tools`, where users rely on the underlying code itself.

Our calculation notes are designed so that users and reviewers can rely on the output—usually a PDF containing LaTeX formulas, tables, and text—without needing to understand the Python code behind it. This ensures that non-programmers can verify calculations without being distracted by the code.

Ultimately, responsibility for the correctness of the calculations rests with the user and technical reviewer, as is typical for engineering documentation.

## Sharing Individual Notebooks

While Poetry works well for managing dependencies at the repository level, it’s common for users to copy individual notebooks into other project directories. It would be inefficient to create full virtual environments for every instance, especially when not all notebooks require the same dependencies.

To address this, I created [nbreqs](https://github.com/miek770/nbreqs), a tool that generates `requirements.txt` files for each Jupyter notebook in a directory. Users can then install only the specific dependencies needed for the notebook they’re working with by running:

```sh
pip install -r <notebook>_requirements.txt
```

You can install nbreqs using [pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx):

```sh
pipx install nbreqs
```

Here’s an example of nbreqs in action. Running it on the `raws` directory generates the following output:

```sh
nbreqs --verbose raws
Generating requirements from: raws/2023-07-13.ipynb
 - energy_tools
 - matplotlib
 - numpy
Generating requirements from: raws/2023-07-30.ipynb
 - calc_note
 - matplotlib
 - more_itertools
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - scipy
 - sklearn
Generating requirements from: raws/2023-09-16.ipynb
 - energy_tools
 - pandapower
```

nbreqs helps streamline dependency management for individual notebooks, ensuring that users only install what’s necessary without needing to worry about the entire repository’s environment.

## Closing Thoughts

Although I’ve only been using Poetry for a short time, the benefits are already clear. It offers a significant improvement over my previous methods, especially when it comes to managing package updates and Python version transitions for the entire team. This should help us avoid running outdated or unsupported versions unnecessarily.

I'm also pleased that the nbreqs tool will make dependency management easier for users, without requiring them to learn yet another tool—unless they choose to.

The next step for nbreqs is to tackle the limitations of the importlib.metadata library, as detailed [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html). [This is a work in progress](https://github.com/miek770/nbreqs/issues/6), and I’m excited to see where it leads.
