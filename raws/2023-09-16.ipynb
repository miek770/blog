    "An alternative which I might use for preliminary studies, is to use IEC results but be mindful of the safety margins added by the IEC correction factors while working with the results. For example, a margin of at least 10% for faults beyond 1 kV, and 5% below 1 kV, is added to the fault currents simply by using the voltage factors. The other corrective factors all add additional margins for specific components."

    "[GridCal](https://www.advancedgridinsights.com/gridcal) supports short circuit calculations, but I was not able to reproduce the results for the example above (neither with the GUI or the CLI). I plan on investigating the issue because its GUI (graphical user interface) is very interesting for quality control and training, even if I mostly use the CLI."

That might have changed; I'll run some tests on the latest version. Note that this is a commercial software."

    "I was a bit disappointed that I could not find any open source solution that performed automatic ANSI/IEEE short circuit calculations in Python out of the box. While the MVA method is easy to use in simple problems, it is unpractical for large distribution models because the contributions have to be combined manually. For preliminary calculations on complex networks I might use [pandapower](https://www.pandapower.org/) and be mindful of its IEC correction factors, but for final calculations I would have to rely on commercial softwares such as [ETAP](https://etap.com/), [EasyPower](https://www.easypower.com/) and [PSSE](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/products/energy/grid-software/planning/pss-software/pss-e.html)."
