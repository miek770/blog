# Python in Excel

*A couple of initial thoughts after trying Python in MS Excel.*

 * talk about when python made it into excel, and cite MS publication.
 * explain why i use and will keep using jupyter notebooks for technical deliverables (quality and efficiency).
 * maybe define what I consider to be an advanced excel user (xlookup, index, etc.) and an expert excel user (external data and VBA)? Not sure if relevant.
 * show examples at each step.
 * show a formula in Excel (PY) with variable names, comments to the source, etc. vs *the old way*.
 * complex numbers, that'd be a huge improvement in python vs traditional excel.
 * try to include a basic power flow with pandapower in excel; not sure that'd work though (probably can't install packages).

About a month ago [Microsoft announced Python in Excel](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-python-in-excel-combining-the-power-of-python-and-the/ba-p/3893439) for users running Beta Channel on Windows, with plans to eventually include this capability in everyone's setup down the road. My main takeaways from this article are:

* Python code can be inserted in cells instead of Excel formulas, and the result is shown in the worksheet.
* An `xl()` function can be used to access cell data in the Python code. ***Does it support ranges?***
* The Python code is executed in the [Microsoft Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-cloud), not on your computer, so custom packages likely cannot be installed.
* The MS Cloud setup uses [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). As stated by Microsoft in [their announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-python-in-excel-combining-the-power-of-python-and-the/ba-p/3893439): *Excel users now have access to powerful analytics via Python for visualizations, cleaning data, machine learning, predictive analytics, and more.*
* Some of the included packages: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), [statsmodel](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and many more.
* From the [Microsoft announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-python-in-excel-combining-the-power-of-python-and-the/ba-p/3893439): *While in Preview, Python in Excel will be included with your Microsoft 365 subscription. After the Preview, some functionality will be restricted without a paid license.*

While I'd love to see this feature as being *free* (included in everyone's Excel), this is definitely great news for any Python enthousiast.
