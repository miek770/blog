# Python in Excel

*A couple of initial thoughts after trying Python in MS Excel.*

 * talk about when python made it into excel, and cite MS publication.
 * explain why i use and will keep using jupyter notebooks for technical deliverables (quality and efficiency).
 * maybe define what I consider to be an advanced excel user (xlookup, index, etc.) and an expert excel user (external data and VBA)? Not sure if relevant.
 * show examples at each step.
 * show a formula in Excel (PY) with variable names, comments to the source, etc. vs *the old way*.
 * complex numbers, that'd be a huge improvement in python vs traditional excel.
 * try to include a basic power flow with pandapower in excel; not sure that'd work though (probably can't install packages).
