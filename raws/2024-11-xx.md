# Clean Deliverables with Quarto

*Clever insight*

I've been using Jupyter Notebooks and nbconvert to create professional PDF calculation notes for years. The inclusion of LaTeX formulas, Markdown blocks and automatic table of contents provides a clean PDF output that can be presented to colleagues and clients, especially if the underlying code is obfuscated.

[Customizing the PDF output](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customizing.html) beyond that, however, is surprisingly complex. Trying to follow the [official documentation for customizing templates](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customizing.html) quickly leads me to numerous [jinja template files](https://palletsprojects.com/projects/jinja/) filled with unfamiliar content (this is all for the LaTeX template):

```
├── base.tex.j2
├── conf.json
├── display_priority.j2
├── document_contents.tex.j2
├── index.tex.j2
├── null.j2
├── report.tex.j2
├── style_bw_ipython.tex.j2
├── style_bw_python.tex.j2
├── style_ipython.tex.j2
├── style_jupyter.tex.j2
└── style_python.tex.j2
```

For example, here're the top 20 lines from `base.tex.j2` (it's 229 lines long):

```
((=- Latex base template (must inherit)
This template builds upon the abstract template, adding common latex output
functions. Figures, data_text,
This template defines defines a default docclass, the inheriting class should
override this.-=))

((*- extends 'document_contents.tex.j2' -*))

%===============================================================================
% Abstract overrides
%===============================================================================

((*- block header -*))
    ((* block docclass *))\documentclass[11pt]{article}((* endblock docclass *))

    ((* block packages *))

    % Basic figure setup, for now with no caption control since it's done
    % automatically by Pandoc (which extracts ![](path) syntax from Markdown).
    \usepackage{graphicx}
```

At the very least, I would like to easily customize the header and footer of my documents and include a company logo.

I believe the solution lies with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), which is specifically designed to be an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. In this article I'll explore a basic setup and workflow to prepare and publish a PDF calculation note with Quarto.

## Installation

There are multiple Quarto builds on [their website](https://quarto.org/docs/download/); the instructions depend on the system but there is an `*.msi` installer for Windows. There is no official build for Arch Linux, but there is a [build on AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/quarto-cli).

After its successful installation, a `quarto` command should be added to your path and accessible from the command line.

## Basis Example

I'm also learning as I go so let's start with a very basic example vaguely inspired by [the generic text editor tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/text-editor.html).
