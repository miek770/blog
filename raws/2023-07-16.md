# Proofreading using ChatGPT

*A guide about how I automated proofreading of my blog posts using the OpenAI API.*

I found a few grammatical errors in my latest article (which have since been fixed) and decided I needed some proofreading before posting. Integrating [OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) was surprisingly easy, and the results were useful with GPT 3.5.

> Unless you have access to free OpenAI credits, submitting requests to OpenAI's API costs money. Make sure you follow your [credit usage on OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage) and ideally run this script manually (with `make review` in this guide).

## API key

To submit requests to the OpenAI API, an API key is required. I found GPT 3.5 to be sufficient for this simple proofreading; if you don't already have an OpenAI account and credits, or don't know how to proceed, I suggest following [this guide](https://openaimaster.com/how-to-access-gpt-3-api-key/) or searching for *"how to get an openai API key"* and looking at recent guides.

Once you have an API key, it needs to be accessible by the code (`review.py`). ***This key must only be accessible by yourself!*** To avoid sharing my own key on GitHub with the source code, I stored it in a `openai_api_key.txt` file and added that file to `.gitignore`.

## The code

The logic is enclosed in the `review.py` file; its source is available on [my blog's GitHub repo](https://github.com/miek770/blog/blob/main/review.py).

Here's the code to make it work, broken into bits; `openai` is obviously needed, `click` is used to manage commandline arguments, and `pathlib` is used to read the article's content and the API key:

```python
import openai
import click
from pathlib import Path
```

`pathlib.Path.is_file()` simply ensures that the target is a valid file; if not, there's no output (`main()` simply does nothing):

```python
@click.command()
@click.argument("file_path", type=str)
def main(file_path: str):
    file = Path(file_path)
    if file.is_file():
```

As mentioned above, my API key is kept secret by ignoring file `openai_api_key.txt` in Git, and loading it with `pathlib.Path`.

ChatGPT's role for this task is defined here; it is a proofreader for my blog.

OpenAI's models are presented in their [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5). I use the 16k version of `gpt-3.5-turbo` because my input and output were too large for the latter.

An alternative approach would be to split the messages into adequately sized chunks, but using simply the 16k model is sufficient for my needs. Here's [an example](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/apps/web-crawl-q-and-a/web-qa.py) and [the Stack Overflow Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75647638/how-to-send-longer-text-inputs-to-chatgpt-api) which led me there.

```python
        openai.api_key = Path("openai_api_key.txt").read_text()
        system_role = "You are a proofreader for my personal blog posts."
        model = "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"
        request = f"""Review and look for grammatical errors in the
following blog post. Clearly highlight the errors in your response:\n\n
{file.read_text()}"""
```

Two messages are sent: The role definition for ChatGPT; and the user request (the task to be performed).

```python
        messages = [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": system_role,
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": request,
            },
        ]
```

The request is sent to OpenAI:

```python
        chat = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
        )
```

The output - the `chat` object - contains both the response (`reply`), and the status (the `finish_reason`, see [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api) for details).

The status should equal "stop" for a complete response. It would equal "length" for an incomplete one (due to token limit); as mentioned above, using the `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model gives me enough tokens to avoid hitting the token limit.

```python
        reply = chat.choices[0].message.content
        status = chat.choices[0].finish_reason

        print(f"Proofreading ({status}): {reply}")
```

Finally, the typical check is used to run the code through a CLI command:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```

This python script (`review.py`) works standalone (except for `openai_api_key.txt`); it doesn't use the rest of the blog's files and modules and thus could easily be adapted to other uses.

## Execution

I prefer using my `Makefile` to manage the blog, so I added a new target to review the last article in `web/articles` (`make publish` must be run prior to the review). The relevant additions to my `Makefile` are as follows:

```makefile
ARTICLES_DIR := web/articles

# Proofreading using ChatGPT
review:
	@echo "Proofreading the latest article..."
	@$(PYTHON) ./review.py $(ARTICLES_DIR)/$(shell ls -1 -t $(ARTICLES_DIR) | tail -1)
```

`$(PYTHON)` is simply the Python command on my machine. I previously used both Windows and Linux to develop, but have since switched to Linux-only so this variable is always set to `python3`.

When `make review` is called, the command enclosed within `$(shell <command>)` is executed and its output replaces the whole variable.

This command returns the filename of the last article in the directory (`review.py` is executed on this file): `ls -1 -t web/articles | tail -1`

## Sample output

Here's the output I get when I run `make review` right after `make publish` (ChatGPT reviews this article up to this point):

```
> make review
Proofreading the latest article...
Proofreading (stop): There are a few grammatical errors in the blog post:

1. In the sentence "Integrating [OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) was surprisingly easy and the results are useful with GPT 3.5," "are" should be "were" to maintain consistency with the past tense of "integrating."

2. In the sentence "Unless you have access to free OpenAI credits, submitting requests to OpenAI's API costs money," "have" should be "had" to maintain consistency with the past tense of "found."

3. In the sentence "To submit requests to the OpenAI' API, an API key is required," the apostrophe after "OpenAI" should be removed.

4. In the sentence "ChatGPT's role for this task is defined here; it's a proofreader for my blog," "it's" should be "it is" to improve clarity.

5. In the sentence "OpenAI's models are presented in its [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)," "its" should be "their" for subject-verb agreement.

6. In the sentence "An alternative approach would be to split the messages into adequately sized chunks, but simply using the 16k model is sufficient for my needs," "but simply" should be "but using simply" for better sentence structure.

7. In the sentence "The output - the `chat` object - contains both the response (`reply`) and the status," there should be a comma after "the response (`reply`)."

8. In the sentence "It would be "length" for an incomplete one," the double quotation marks should be single quotation marks instead.

9. In the sentence "This python script (`review.py`) works standalone," "python script" should not be capitalized.

10. In the sentence "I previously used both Windows and Linux to develop, but have since switched to Linux only so this variable is always set to `python3`," "Linux only" should be changed to "Linux-only" for correct hyphenation.

Apart from these errors, the blog post appears to be well-written and informative.
```

<br />
Although I don't fully agree with items 2 and 8, and item 9 is just wrong ("python script" was not capitalized), this is definitely valuable feedback.

## Next steps

This utility already works well as is, but could still be improved. The following comes to mind:

* Try other models, including `gpt-4`, to check if they perform better (i.e.: Provide even more valuable feedback).
* Optimize my request to get broader feedback, for example about the clarity of my article. The response I recieved above seems to solely focus on grammar.

## Conclusion

The guide shows how I automated proofreading of my blog posts with ChatGPT, using the OpenAI API and a few lines of Python code. This simple approach - which actually took me less time to implement than the preparation of this article - provides valuable feedback, and a few improvements are suggested.

I consider this as an additional tool pre-publication; not a complete replacement for human proofreading. Nonetheless, anything this method catches before invovling another person will make their review than much easier.
