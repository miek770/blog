# My Python TUI Project Template

*How I aim to start every new Python TUI project from now on using uv, Textual and Nuitka.*

I think a lot about managing my [Python](https://www.python.org/) projects these days, encouraged both by the contribution of colleagues to my work projects and distribution of tools in various formats within and beyond my company. Simply using `requirements.txt` files doesn't cut it anymore, and I do not want to have to troubleshoot problems that could automatically be resolved by using adequate tools.

I've recently started using poetry, as shown in my [previous post](2024-09-28). I have however been hearing a lot about [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [Python Bytes' episode 404](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/404/the-lost-episode)'s reference to Hynek's video [uv IS the Future of Python Packaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UuW8o4bHbw) convinced me to give it a try. I don't have enough experience with either yet to explain why I would prefer one over the other, so I'm using both on different projects for the time being.

The other thing I've been meaning to try for a while is [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) to build terminal user interfaces (TUI). Something about its aesthetics, useability, and capabilities is so deeply satisfying. Its flexibility means that I could use it for many types of applications, and it would be quite smaller as a single file program (compiled with [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)) compared to GUI solutions.

>Note that this template is not prepared for projects I intend to distribute on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), which is why I don't cover packaging in this article.

This template is shared [here on GitHub](https://github.com/miek770/python_uv_nuitka_tui_template); see below for details about its content.

## Requirements

Before going further, there are a few prerequisites you'll need to take care of.

I find it rather interesting that [Python](https://www.python.org/) itself is not part of the requirements. I honestly haven't tested this on a system without the matching Python version, but [uv will automatically fetch Python versions as needed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/#automatic-python-downloads)!

### uv

The main requirement needed to use this template is [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which can be installed by following its [installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Make

To build the application with [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) on Linux, I needed to install the following packages on Arch Linux. These requirements will differ depending on the operating system; refer to [Nuitka's documentation](https://nuitka.net/user-documentation/) for details:

- `ccache`: To speed up subsequent builds.
- `gcc`: To compile the application.
- `make`: To process the `Makefile`.
- `patchelf`: To use the `--standalone` option on Linux.

When distributing [Python](https://www.python.org/) projects, I typically either want to distribute it as a package for developers (i.e.: Python source files), or as a compiled binary file for non-developers. Solutions that bundle the project and its requirements, e.g.: [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/), do not satisfy me. [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) summarizes its benefits thusly (free version):

1. **IP Protection**: Compiling your source code for security (the compiled code is not human-readable).
2. **Performance**: Boost your program runtime and launch performance.
3. **Deployment**: Enjoy hassle-free Python deployment with standalone distributions, onefile, PyPI wheels, and more.

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is optional (version control system), but I use it for each of my software projects and to save this template on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/miek770/python_uv_nuitka_tui_template).

I believe it's quite ubiquitous these days, but I still see people developing and maintaining projects without any version control apart from manual backups (dated ZIP files) and file synchronization services. Using a version control system like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is essential for managing code across different stages of development. It lets you track changes, experiment with new ideas without losing previous work, and collaborate with others by merging contributions. With [Git](https://git-scm.com/), rolling back to a previous version is straightforward if something goes wrong, and you can create branches to test features or fix bugs in isolation. It also ensures that the project's history is stored safely, making it easier to maintain over time.


With the requirements out of the way, the template is ready to be used!

## Usage

Reusing this template takes a few easy steps:

1. Clone the template repository (origin):

```
git clone git@github.com:miek770/python_uv_nuitka_tui_template.git
```

2. Disconnect the clone from its origin (we want to create a new project, not modify the template):

```
git remote remove origin
```

3. Synchronize the [Python](https://www.python.org/) project with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); this will install the relevant Python version - if required - and all dependencies:

```
uv sync
```

4. Install pre-commit hooks, to automate some validations before accepting each [Git](https://git-scm.com/) commit:

```
uv run pre-commit install
uv run pre-commit
```

That's all! From this point on, packages can be added with `uv add <package>`, tests can be run with `make tests`, and builds can be compiled with `make build`.

Once I'm happy with my progress and ready for my first commit, I attach and push the project to a blank repository with the following commands (after running `git commit -m <message>`):

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git
git push
```

In the next section I'll go over some of the decisions I made to put this template together.

## Template Details

Here's the content of my template, with details below for each file and directory:

```
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── pyproject.toml
├── .python-version
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── __init__.py
│   ├── tui.py
├── tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_hello.py
└── uv.lock
```

>I generated this output with `tree -a --gitignore` on Linux; the `-a` option includes hidden files and the `--gitignore` considers the content of my `.gitignore` file to ignore irrelevant files and directories.

## File `.gitignore`

My `.gitignore` file contains:

```
*.bin
*build
*dist
*.egg-info
.git
.mypy_cache
__pycache__
.pytest_cache
.venv
*.xml
```

As mentioned above, using the `--gitignore` option with `tree` considers the content of this file to map files and directories structures.

Its content is rather minimal and will need to be extended (and perhaps structured) for real projects. For exemple, I would add a `*.exe` exclusion for Windows builds. There are great examples of `.gitignore` files for [Python](https://www.python.org/) projects on the web, but I prefer to add exclusions manually as I encounter them rather than use comprehensive examples that go well beyond my real needs.

## File `LICENSE`

I use the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit) for each of my open source projects.

## File `Makefile`

I'm not sure yet if and how I should set up such actions with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), so for now I'll stick with a good old `Makefile`. I should extend it to adapt the build depending on the machine (the [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) options won't be the same on Windows), but in the meantime here it is:

```Makefile
build:
	uv run nuitka --onefile src/tui.py

tests:
	uv run pytest

.PHONY: build tests
```

>Please let me know if you know how to set this up with `uv`, i.e.: Without using a `Makefile`. It might become possible in the future, or I might simply have missed it in my research.

## File `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

This file applies a few hooks, including [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), before each commit. They can also be launched manually with `uv run pre-commit`:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v5.0.0
    hooks:
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: check-added-large-files
-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 24.10.0
    hooks:
    -   id: black
```

[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), described as *The uncompromising code formatter*, forcibly applies strict and well recognized formatting rules to your code without your direct intervention. It can be customized, but I prefer to adhere to its default settings and force contributors to follow suit. It allows us all to focus on the arguably more important stuff!

## Files `pyproject.toml`, `.python-version` and `uv.lock`

In the template these file are entirely generated and managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). `pyproject.toml` will be adapted per project; here's its current content:

```toml
[project]
name = "uv-nuitka-textual-template"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "textual>=0.83.0",
]

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    "black>=24.10.0",
    "nuitka>=2.4.8",
    "pre-commit>=4.0.1",
    "pytest>=8.3.3",
    "pytest-asyncio>=0.24.0",
    "pytest-textual-snapshot>=1.0.0",
]
```

The `pytest-asyncio` and `pytest-textual-snapshot` libraries are required to test the TUI interface (see basic test below).

>I could have included all dependencies without the `--dev` flag because projects based on this template are not meant to be distributed uncompiled; there is no expected `--no-dev` use case. I still left it as is because it felt like good practice and `uv` will install development dependencies by default (`--dev` is assumed with `uv sync`).

## File `README.md`

Pretty typical, there are so many great resources online to help create readme files with tips, tools and examples.

There are also generators, which I sometimes use to create rough drafts rather than final versions, but I'm not very fond of this approach.

As a reminder for future me, animations are great and I should use them more. I've recently tried [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) and liked it, but the fact that I couldn't embed the animation to my [GitHub](https://github.com/) readme bothers me (it's a link to asciinema's website). I would prefer generating and embedding an animated `.gif`.

I have yet to try it, but [Terminalizer](https://www.terminalizer.com/) seems like a fine solution, in addition to having a great name.

## Directory `src`

The `src` directory contains the source code for my application; the `tui.py` file will be its entry point. If I extend my application with CLI and GUI interfaces, `cli.py` and `gui.py` files will be added for each one.

The `__init__.py` file is needed for [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

### File `src/tui.py`

This file simply contains the necessary code for a *hello world* demo on [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/):

```python
from textual.app import App
from textual.widgets import Input, Button, Header, Footer, Static
from textual.containers import Container


class HelloApp(App):

    BINDINGS = [
        ("d", "toggle_dark", "Toggle dark mode"),
        ("q", "quit", "Quit"),
    ]

    def compose(self):
        yield Header()
        yield Footer()
        yield Container(
            Input(placeholder="Enter your name", id="name_input"),
            Button(label="Submit", id="submit_button"),
            Static(id="greeting_output"),
        )

    def on_button_pressed(self, event: Button.Pressed):
        name_input = self.query_one("#name_input", Input)
        greeting_output = self.query_one("#greeting_output", Static)
        name = name_input.value.strip()
        if name:
            greeting_output.update(f"Hello {name}!")
        else:
            greeting_output.update("Please enter a valid name.")

    def action_toggle_dark(self) -> None:
        self.dark = not self.dark

    def action_quit(self):
        self.exit()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    HelloApp().run()
```

The 2 bindings defined at the beginning of the class definition, i.e. `toggle_dark` and `quit`, are automatically linked to [Textual Actions](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/actions/) called when the associated keys are pressed.

## Directory `tests`

The `tests` directory is used automatically by [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to find an execute automated tests. I try to include sufficient tests in my projects and thus included a basic one to check the generation of the TUI.

It should be extended to testing the TUI response to input; see [Textual testing](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/testing/) for details. For now, here's my basic test for this template:

```python
import pytest

from app.hello import HelloApp


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_initial_state():
    """Test that the initial state of the app is correct."""
    app = HelloApp()

    async with app.run_test() as pilot:
        assert app.screen.get_widget_by_id("name_input").value == ""
        assert "Submit" in app.screen.get_widget_by_id("submit_button").label
        assert app.screen.get_widget_by_id("greeting_output").renderable == ""
```

I can't say I have ever *really* followed test driven development practices for a complete project, but I nonetheless mostly aim to follow its principles and start developping new functionality by writing tests with the expected outputs. I find this to be especially valuable when implementing well documented technical principles where published examples can be used as recognizable tests, for example power system calculations and studies. Quality control is of paramount importance in my field and the fact that part of it can be automated with tests is invaluable.

## Conclusion

I have only very recently started using `uv` and `Textual` and both motivate me to make new projects (or rewrite existing projects, which I'm trying to resist). This template along with a few others (TUI, CLI, GUI and [Python](https://www.python.org/) package) will ease their creation in a somewhat standardized way and help me familiarize myself with the toolkit I have chosen to use.

I'm sure this article will be useful for myself in the future; I hope it'll help others as well!

There are a few things I might add to this template (and others) in the future, e.g. documentation, examples and media folders. For packages and projects with an API, I would like to relearn how to use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to generate documentation from comments. I would also like to learn about [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and get started with using Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) on some projects, and that might also affect this template.
